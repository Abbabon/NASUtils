# TODO

## NAS integration
* [ ] add cloning and updating scripts for the actual NAS, so I don't have to copy the configuration manually over there

* [ ] Add progress logs of some kind (every 10 files?)

## General Future Improvements
* [ ] Add unit tests for all utilities
* [ ] Create unified logging configuration across all scripts
